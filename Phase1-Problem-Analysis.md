### Phase 1: Full Project Analysis

This document completes the initial discovery and planning phase for the Pharma-Track system. It includes an analysis of key stakeholders, a mapping of business processes, and an exploration of potential AppExchange solutions.

### 1. Requirement Gathering

1. Medication & Inventory Information
The system requires a complete and accurate view of all medication stock to prevent errors and ensure availability. We will use the standard Product object to represent each medication.

Required Fields:

Product Name (Standard) - e.g., "Amoxicillin 500mg".

Standard Price (Standard) - The wholesale cost of the medication.

Manufacturer (Custom Field) - The company that produced the drug.

Category (Picklist Field) - e.g., "Antibiotic", "Analgesic", "Antihistamine".

Expiration Date (Custom Field) - A date field to track the shelf life.

Lot Number (Custom Field) - A text field to record the specific production lot for recalls.

Quantity on Hand (Standard) - The current stock count.

2. Customer Information
We will manage customer information to track prescriptions and provide a better patient experience. We will use the standard Contact object for this.

Required Fields:

First Name (Standard)

Last Name (Standard)

Mobile Phone (Standard) - For prescription refill reminders.

Email (Standard) - For communication and confirmations.

Patient ID (Custom Field) - A unique identifier.

3. Prescription & Dispensing Information
This is the core custom object that will link a patient to the medications they receive. We will create a new Custom Object called Prescription.

Required Fields:

Prescription ID (Standard Auto-Number) - A unique ID for each prescription, e.g., PRES-0001.

Patient (Master-Detail Relationship to Contact) - A lookup to the patient.

Medication (Lookup Relationship to Product) - A lookup to the medication being dispensed.

Quantity Dispensed (Number Field) - The amount of medication given to the patient.

Status (Picklist Field) - Values: "Pending", "Dispensed", "Refilled", "Completed".

Date Dispensed (Date/Time Field) - The date the medication was given to the patient.

### 2. Stakeholder Analysis


3. Business Process Mapping
This section outlines the current manual processes ("As-Is") and how they will be improved with the new Pharma-Track system ("To-Be").

Stakeholder Role	Their Primary Goal	What They Need from the System
Pharmacy Owner/Manager	Ensure profitability, optimize inventory, and maintain compliance.	Real-time dashboards, sales reports, inventory valuation, and expiration alerts.
Pharmacist/Technician	Dispense medications accurately and safely, manage stock, and assist patients.	A simple interface for logging sales, real-time stock levels, and a system for tracking lot numbers and expiration dates.
Patient	Receive the correct medication in a timely manner.	A reliable system that ensures their prescribed medication is in stock and ready for them.

Process: Dispensing a Prescription

As-Is (Current Manual Process)	To-Be (Future Salesforce Process)
1. Pharmacist searches for medication on a shelf.	1. Pharmacist scans a barcode or searches for the medication in Salesforce.
2. Manually writes down the sale on a spreadsheet or paper log.	2. A new Prescription record is created, linking the medication to the patient.
3. Manually updates the stock count.	3. The Quantity on Hand for that medication is automatically decremented.
Outcome: Prone to data entry errors, slow, and leads to inaccurate stock levels.	Outcome: Fast, accurate, real-time stock counts are maintained automatically, and an audit trail is created.


Process: Managing Expired Inventory

As-Is (Current Manual Process)	To-Be (Future Salesforce Process)
1. Staff must physically check expiration dates on shelves.	1. The system automatically scans all inventory.
2. If they miss a date, the product expires and is wasted.	2. An automated alert is sent to the pharmacist, notifying them of upcoming expirations.
3. A financial loss is incurred.	3. Staff can proactively discount or return products before they expire, minimizing waste.
Outcome: Financial losses and patient safety risks from potentially expired medication.	Outcome: Financial losses are minimized, and patient safety is improved with timely alerts.

### 4. Industry-Specific Use Case Analysis

This section analyzes unique processes for the pharmaceutical industry that the Pharma-Track system must handle.

Use Case 1: Lot Number Tracking & Recalls

Industry Need: Pharmacists must be able to quickly identify and pull all inventory from a specific production batch in the event of a product recall.

Salesforce Solution: By creating a custom Lot Number field on the Product object, we can ensure that every medication is tracked by its specific lot. A simple report can be run to find all medications from a specific lot number, allowing for a rapid and accurate recall process.

Use Case 2: Multi-location Inventory Management

Industry Need: Pharmacies often have multiple locations or storage areas, and knowing the exact location of a drug is critical.

Salesforce Solution: We can use Salesforce Inventory Management features or a custom Location object with a lookup to the Product object. This will allow pharmacists to see not only how much of a medication they have, but also exactly where it's stored (e.g., "Main Shelf A," "Refrigerator," or "Warehouse B").
