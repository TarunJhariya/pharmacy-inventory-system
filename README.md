1. The Problem
Many pharmacies still manage their stock using manual methods like spreadsheets or a paper-based system. This old-fashioned approach creates major issues that impact business performance and patient safety:

Inaccurate Stock Counts: It's easy to make mistakes when manually updating inventory, which can lead to running out of essential medications or overstocking, tying up money. Without a real-time system, staff can't quickly confirm if a drug is available, delaying prescription fulfillment.

Loss from Expired Medications: Without an automated way to track and alert staff about expiration dates, pharmacies risk significant financial loss by having to discard expired products. More importantly, there is a risk of dispensing medication that is past its shelf life, which is a major patient safety concern.

Inefficient Staff Workflow: The time spent on manual tasks like checking stock, writing down orders, and looking up product information is time that could be spent on patient care. This manual work is slow and prone to error.

Lack of Actionable Insights: Pharmacy owners and managers cannot easily see critical business data like top-selling drugs, seasonal demand trends, or the value of their current inventory. This makes it difficult to make smart purchasing decisions and optimize business operations.
